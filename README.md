# orderbook

A cross-company **order-book dashboard for Indian listed companies**.

Indian listed companies file BSE exchange announcements when they win orders or
contracts. This app polls those filings, uses an LLM to read each one and
extract five fields — **value, awarder, duration, target industry, description**
— plus a link to the source filing, then shows every order across **all**
companies in one dashboard, newest first, with per-company history.

Every data point stays **source- and evidence-backed**: each order links to its
original filing and shows where its data came from. Never a black box.

> **Status: Step 1 of ~12 — scaffold only.** The skeleton runs and can deploy.
> Real scraping, real LLM extraction, and the final DB schema come in later
> steps. The UI is a static, colorful placeholder with mock data.

## Architecture

- **Monorepo** deployed to **Cloudflare on push to `main`**.
- **`/web`** — Next.js (App Router + TypeScript + TailwindCSS), deployed to
  **Cloudflare Workers** via the **OpenNext** adapter
  (`@opennextjs/cloudflare`). Reads data from **Cloudflare D1** through a
  binding named **`DB`**.
- **`/ingestion`** — Python. Runs on **GitHub Actions** (manual "Run workflow"
  for now; scheduled later). Fetches BSE/Screener data via **Firecrawl** and
  **Scrape.do**, reads the filing PDF, calls **OpenAI** to extract the five
  fields, then writes rows into **Cloudflare D1 via D1's HTTP API**.
- **`/db`** — shared SQL schema + migrations for D1.
- **Database** — Cloudflare **D1** (SQLite). The dashboard reads it via the
  `DB` binding; Python writes to it via D1's HTTP API.

**Design principles** (apply to all UI): light, colorful, visual-heavy, and
modern — _not_ a dark "terminal/Bloomberg" look. Every order card links to its
original filing and shows where its data came from.

## GitHub Secrets

Set these in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**. They are consumed
by the ingestion pipeline (`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`) and mirror
`.env.example`.

**Required**

| Secret               | Used for                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | LLM field extraction                       |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`  | Fetch + parse pages/PDFs                    |
| `SCRAPEDO_API_KEY`   | Proxied fetch for BSE                       |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`      | Cloudflare account (D1 write target)       |
| `CF_D1_DATABASE_ID`  | Cloudflare D1 database id                   |
| `CF_API_TOKEN`       | Cloudflare API token (D1 edit permission)  |

**Optional**

| Secret              | Used for                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `SCREENER_EMAIL`    | screener.in login (optional) |
| `SCREENER_PASSWORD` | screener.in login (optional) |
| `MUNS_TOKEN`        | internal token (optional)    |

The web dashboard does **not** use these secrets — it reads D1 through the
Cloudflare Worker binding **`DB`** (configured in `web/wrangler.jsonc`).

## Run `/web` locally

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the **light, colorful placeholder dashboard**: an app header, a
KPI/stat row, and an "Orders" grid of mock order cards (each showing the five
fields plus a "View source filing" link).

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build        # Next.js production build
npm run preview      # Build with OpenNext and preview the Worker locally
npm run deploy       # Build with OpenNext and deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run cf-typegen   # Generate cloudflare-env.d.ts from wrangler.jsonc bindings
```

### Deploying to Cloudflare (Workers Builds)

The app lives in `web/` (a monorepo subdirectory) and deploys via the **OpenNext**
adapter — it is **not** a plain static/Worker deploy. The connected Worker must
be configured so its build runs OpenNext from `web/`. In the Cloudflare
dashboard → your Worker → **Settings → Build**:

| Setting              | Value                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Root directory       | `web`                              |
| Build command        | `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`  |
| Deploy command       | `npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` |

> The default `npx wrangler deploy` (run at the repo root) **fails** — there is
> no `wrangler.jsonc` at the root and no OpenNext build has run, so wrangler
> reports _"Could not detect a directory containing static files"_. The Worker
> `name` in `web/wrangler.jsonc` must also match the connected Worker (`orderbook`).

**Before the first real deploy — provision the remote D1** (until then the deploy
fails on the `DB` binding because `database_id` is a placeholder):

```bash
cd web
npx wrangler d1 create orderbook          # paste the returned id into wrangler.jsonc
npm run db:migrate:remote                  # apply the schema to the remote D1
```

Also set the same id as the `CF_D1_DATABASE_ID` GitHub secret (used by ingestion).

## Run `/ingestion` locally

```bash
cd ingestion
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # optional
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp ../.env.example ../.env    # then fill in values (optional for the readiness check)
python main.py
```

`main.py` prints a **readiness check** — which env vars are set (never their
values) — and exits `0`. Missing secrets are reported but don't fail the run at
this stage.

## What's stubbed for later

- **Ingestion clients** — `firecrawl_client.py`, `scrapedo_client.py`,
  `openai_client.py` are stubs with `TODO`s and `NotImplementedError`.
- **DB schema** — `db/migrations/0001_init.sql` is a placeholder `orders` table.
  The real schema is Step 2.
- **Scheduling** — `ingest.yml` runs manually; the `schedule:` block is
  commented out for later.
- **Dashboard** — static mock data, no filters/search/history yet.
